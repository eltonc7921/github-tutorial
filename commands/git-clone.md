# git clone
**Function:** obtains a repository from the remote server and copies it onto local server.

Cloning a repository that isn't yours will result in not being able to push any changes that you have made to the remote repository.

[Forking](../vocabulary/fork.md) will allow you to save your changes onto the remote repository after cloning a forked repository.

*Example 1:*
```
~/repository/ $ git clone <link/sshkey>
```
