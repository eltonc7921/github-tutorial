# git init
**Function:** "init"ializes the current directory into a git repository.

*Example:*
```
~/repository/ $ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in ~/repository/.git
```

**git init in the wrong directory:**

in the same directory use the command `rm -rf .git` to delete the folder that makes the directory a repository
> `rm -rf` is very dangerous and could delete any directory with no way to getting it back
